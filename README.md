</p>

### Get `prettier.vim`
You'll need to install [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) if you haven't already. For example, I used npm:
```
npm install -g prettier
```

Use your favorite vim plugin manager. If you don't have one, I like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
To add it to your plugins, use:
```
Plug 'ebuckthal/prettier.vim'
```

### Usage
To format the entire buffer or visual selection, type
```
:Prettier<cr>
```
in normal mode or in selection mode.

I like to have `prettier` run every time I save the file I'm working on. To do that, add the following to your .vimrc:
```
augroup fmt
  autocmd!
  autocmd BufWritePre *.js try | silent undojoin | catch | endtry | Prettier 
augroup END
```

Any errors generated by `prettier` will automatically populate the quickfix list. Makes pretty javascript a breeze!âœ¨

### Configuration
By default, `prettier` is run with as `prettier --single-quote all --trailing-comma --stdin`. If you'd like to change it, override the following variable in your ~/.vimrc somewhere. As an example:
```
let g:prettier_cmd = 'prettier --single-quote all --stdin'
```

### Contributing
Development of `prettier.vim` is facilitated exclusively on GitHub. Any contributions in the form of Pull Requests are very welcome and highly encouraged. If you find an issue or have a question with this plugin, open an Issue.
