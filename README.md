</p>

### Get `prettier.vim`
Requires an executable [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to exist in $PATH 

Use your favorite vim plugin manager. If you don't have one, I like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
To add it to your plugins, use:
```
Plug 'ebuckthal/prettier.vim'
```

### Configuration
`prettier.vim` will automatically be set up to run on file save. Any errors thrown by `prettier` will automatically populate the quickfix list. Makes pretty javascript a breeze!âœ¨

### Contributing
Development of `prettier.vim` is facilitated exclusively on GitHub. Any contributions in the form of Pull Requests are very welcome and highly encouraged. If you find an issue or have a question with this plugin, open an Issue.
